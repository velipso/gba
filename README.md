Gameboy Advance Notes and Scripts
=================================

These are my personal notes and scripts I'm collecting while learning about developing games for the
Gameboy Advance.  Maybe they'll be useful to the homebrew community eventually.

Note that the entire repo is a **work in progress**.  Feel free to poke around but certainly don't
rely on anything!
